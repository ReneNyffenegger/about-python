[script.py](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-python/blob/master/standard-library/SimpleHTTPServer/script.py) creates a most basic WebServer. If the script is started
from the directory in which it is found, a browser pointing at `localhost:8888` will be served
[index.html](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-python/blob/master/standard-library/SimpleHTTPServer/index.html). `index.html` in turn links to `script.py`.


Alternatively, you could just enter
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777
on the command line.
