`Requests` is a HTTP library for human beings.

Installation: `pip install requests`

Note, when I tried to install this library on Windows under Username `Ren√©` (Note the accent), I received a `UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 57: ordinal not in range(128)`.
I could fix this by changing the env variable `USERNAME` to a value without accent.
